# Dash Layout

This tutorial will walk you through a fundamental aspect of Dash apps, the app layout, through six self-contained apps.

For production Dash apps, we recommend styling the app layout with Dash Enterprise Design Kit.

Dash apps are composed of two parts. The first part is the "layout", which describes what the app looks like. The second part describes the interactivity of the app and will be covered in the next chapter.

To get started, create a file named P1.01.layout.py , copy the code below into it, and then run it with python P1.01.layout.py.

```python :
# Run this app with `python app.py` and
# visit http://127.0.0.1:8050/ in your web browser.


from dash import Dash, html, dcc
import plotly.express as px
import pandas as pd

app = Dash(__name__)

# assume you have a "long-form" data frame
# see https://plotly.com/python/px-arguments/ for more options
df = pd.DataFrame({
    "Fruit": ["Apples", "Oranges", "Bananas", "Apples", "Oranges", "Bananas"],
    "Amount": [4, 1, 2, 2, 4, 5],
    "City": ["SF", "SF", "SF", "Montreal", "Montreal", "Montreal"]
})

fig = px.bar(df, x="Fruit", y="Amount", color="City", barmode="group")

app.layout = html.Div(children=[
    html.H1(children='Hello Dash'),

    html.Div(children='''
        Dash: A web application framework for your data.
    '''),

    dcc.Graph(
        id='example-graph',
        figure=fig
    )
])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```
