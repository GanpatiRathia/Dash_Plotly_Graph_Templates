# Dash in 20 Minutes

By the end of this tutorial, you will understand the basic building blocks of Dash and you will know how to build this app:

```python :
# Import packages
from dash import Dash, html, dash_table, dcc, callback, Output, Input
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

# Incorporate data
df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/gapminder2007.csv')

# Initialize the app
app = Dash(__name__)

# App layout
app.layout = html.Div([
    html.Div(children='My First App with Data, Graph, and Controls'),
    html.Hr(),
    dcc.RadioItems(options=['pop', 'lifeExp', 'gdpPercap'], value='lifeExp', id='my-final-radio-item-example'),
    dash_table.DataTable(data=df.to_dict('records'), page_size=6),
    dcc.Graph(figure={}, id='my-final-graph-example')
])

# Add controls to build the interaction
@callback(
    Output(component_id='my-final-graph-example', component_property='figure'),
    Input(component_id='my-final-radio-item-example', component_property='value')
)
def update_graph(col_chosen):
    fig = px.histogram(df, x='continent', y=col_chosen, histfunc='avg')
    return fig

# Run the app
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

## Hello World

Building and launching an app with Dash can be done with just 7 lines of code.

Open a Python IDE on your computer, create an 03.HelloWorld.py file with the code below and install Dash if you haven't done so already. To launch the app, type into your terminal the command python 03.HelloWorld.py. Then, go to the http link.

Alternatively, with Dash 2.11 or later, you can run this app and other examples from this documentation in a Jupyter Notebook.

The code below creates a very small "Hello World" Dash app.

```python :
from dash import Dash, html

app = Dash(__name__)

app.layout = html.Div([
    html.Div(children='Hello World')
])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```
<!--Output  -->

## Hello World: Code Breakdown

```python :
# Import packages
from dash import Dash, html
```
When creating Dash apps, you will almost always use the import statement above. As you create more advanced Dash apps, you will import more packages.

```python :
# Initialize the app
app = Dash(__name__)
```
This line is known as the Dash constructor and is responsible for initializing your app. It is almost always the same for any Dash app you create.

```python :
# App layout
app.layout = html.Div([
    html.Div(children='Hello World')
])
```
The app layout represents the app components that will be displayed in the web browser, normally contained within a html.Div. In this example, a single component was added: another html.Div. The Div has a few properties, such as children, which we use to add text content to the page: "Hello World".

```python :
# Run the app
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```
These lines are for running your app, and they are almost always the same for any Dash app you create.

## Connecting to Data
There are many ways to add data to an app: APIs, external databases, local .txt files, JSON files, and more. In this example, we will highlight one of the most common ways of incorporating data from a CSV sheet.

Create the 03.ConnectingToData.py code from the previous section with the code below. Then, install pandas (pip install pandas) and launch the app.

```python :
# Import packages
from dash import Dash, html, dash_table
import pandas as pd

# Incorporate data
df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/gapminder2007.csv')

# Initialize the app
app = Dash(__name__)

# App layout
app.layout = html.Div([
    html.Div(children='My First App with Data'),
    dash_table.DataTable(data=df.to_dict('records'), page_size=10)
])

# Run the app
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```
<!--Output 03.ConnectingToData.py-->

## Connect to Data: Code Breakdown

```python :
# Import packages
from dash import Dash, html, dash_table
import pandas as pd
```

We import the dash_table module to display the data inside a Dash DataTable. We also import the pandas library to read the CSV sheet data.

```python :
# Incorporate data
df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/gapminder2007.csv')
```

Here we read the CSV sheet into a pandas dataframe. This will make it easier to slice, filter, and inspect the data.

If you prefer to use a CSV sheet that is on your computer (and not online), make sure to save it in the same folder that contains the app.py file. Then, update the line of code to: df = pd.read_csv('NameOfYourFile.csv')

If you're using an Excel sheet, make sure to pip install openpyxl. Then, update the line of code to: df = pd.read_excel('NameOfYourFile.xlsx', sheet_name='Sheet1')

Tip: You can read the pandas docs on reading data if your data is in a different format, or consider using another Python library if you are connecting to a specific database type or file format. For example, if you're considering using Databricks as a backend for your Dash app, you may review their Python documentation for recommendations on how to connect.

```python :
# App layout
app.layout = html.Div([
    html.Div(children='My First App with Data'),
    dash_table.DataTable(data=df.to_dict('records'), page_size=10)
])
```

In addition to the app title, we add the DataTable component and read the pandas dataframe into the table.

## Visualizing Data

The Plotly graphing library has more than 50 chart types to choose from. In this example, we will make use of the histogram chart.

Create the app.py code from the previous section with the code below.

```python :
# Import packages
from dash import Dash, html, dash_table, dcc
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

# Incorporate data
df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/gapminder2007.csv')

# Initialize the app
app = Dash(__name__)

# App layout
app.layout = html.Div([
    html.Div(children='My First App with Data and a Graph'),
    dash_table.DataTable(data=df.to_dict('records'), page_size=10),
    dcc.Graph(figure=px.histogram(df, x='continent', y='lifeExp', histfunc='avg'))
])

# Run the app
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```
