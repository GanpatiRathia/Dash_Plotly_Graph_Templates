# Dash in 20 Minutes

By the end of this tutorial, you will understand the basic building blocks of Dash and you will know how to build this app:

```python :
# Import packages
from dash import Dash, html, dash_table, dcc, callback, Output, Input
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

# Incorporate data
df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/gapminder2007.csv')

# Initialize the app
app = Dash(__name__)

# App layout
app.layout = html.Div([
    html.Div(children='My First App with Data, Graph, and Controls'),
    html.Hr(),
    dcc.RadioItems(options=['pop', 'lifeExp', 'gdpPercap'], value='lifeExp', id='my-final-radio-item-example'),
    dash_table.DataTable(data=df.to_dict('records'), page_size=6),
    dcc.Graph(figure={}, id='my-final-graph-example')
])

# Add controls to build the interaction
@callback(
    Output(component_id='my-final-graph-example', component_property='figure'),
    Input(component_id='my-final-radio-item-example', component_property='value')
)
def update_graph(col_chosen):
    fig = px.histogram(df, x='continent', y=col_chosen, histfunc='avg')
    return fig

# Run the app
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

## Hello World

Building and launching an app with Dash can be done with just 7 lines of code.

Open a Python IDE on your computer, create an 03.HelloWorld.py file with the code below and install Dash if you haven't done so already. To launch the app, type into your terminal the command python 03.HelloWorld.py. Then, go to the http link.

Alternatively, with Dash 2.11 or later, you can run this app and other examples from this documentation in a Jupyter Notebook.

The code below creates a very small "Hello World" Dash app.

```python :
from dash import Dash, html

app = Dash(__name__)

app.layout = html.Div([
    html.Div(children='Hello World')
])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Follow this example gif (using VS Code) if you are not sure how to set up the app:

## Hello World: Code Breakdown

```python :
# Import packages
from dash import Dash, html
```
When creating Dash apps, you will almost always use the import statement above. As you create more advanced Dash apps, you will import more packages.

```python :
# Initialize the app
app = Dash(__name__)
```
This line is known as the Dash constructor and is responsible for initializing your app. It is almost always the same for any Dash app you create.

```python :
# App layout
app.layout = html.Div([
    html.Div(children='Hello World')
])
```
The app layout represents the app components that will be displayed in the web browser, normally contained within a html.Div. In this example, a single component was added: another html.Div. The Div has a few properties, such as children, which we use to add text content to the page: "Hello World".

```python :
# Run the app
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```
These lines are for running your app, and they are almost always the same for any Dash app you create.

## Connecting to Data
There are many ways to add data to an app: APIs, external databases, local .txt files, JSON files, and more. In this example, we will highlight one of the most common ways of incorporating data from a CSV sheet.

Replace the app.py code from the previous section with the code below. Then, install pandas (pip install pandas) and launch the app.

```python :
# Import packages
from dash import Dash, html, dash_table
import pandas as pd

# Incorporate data
df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/gapminder2007.csv')

# Initialize the app
app = Dash(__name__)

# App layout
app.layout = html.Div([
    html.Div(children='My First App with Data'),
    dash_table.DataTable(data=df.to_dict('records'), page_size=10)
])

# Run the app
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```
