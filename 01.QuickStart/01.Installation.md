# Dash Installation
## In your terminal, install dash.

pip install dash

## This also brings along the plotly graphing library. This library is under active development, so install and upgrade frequently.

## We also recommend installing Pandas, which is required by Plotly Express and used in many of our examples.

pip install pandas

## With Dash installed, you can run the examples in the documentation in an app.py file with python app.py, or in a Jupyter Notebook.

These docs are running dash version 2.16.1.
